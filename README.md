### Description:

The data were collected as part of a field campaign in Sermilik Fjord, Southeast Greenland during August 2021.A Seabird 25plus CTD (serial number 0251108) was used to collect 27 salinity, temperature, and dissolved profiles. An RBR Concerto CTD (serial 66130) was attached to the rosette to provide profiles of turbidity. The RBR was only attached to the rosette for a subset of casts and provided erroneous data for casts 15-27.The profiles were manually examined to remove erroneous spikes. They were then averaged into 1-m bins.The survey includes an along-fjord section and a section across the mouth of the fjord.
